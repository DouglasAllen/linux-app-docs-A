email_extra_info='
The test environment is an amd64 Xen guest with limited amounts of
memory.  The relevant dependencies are installed for each test but
very few other packages.  Most autopkgtest reports are FTBFS problems.

Please forgive this bug report if the problem is due to archive skew;
in that case you'\''ve just been unlucky with the timing.  Feel free to
close the bug if the skew has been fixed, or will be fixed soon.
