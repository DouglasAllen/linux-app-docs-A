<H1>Appendix : Anarchism and Marxism</h1>
<p>
This appendix exists to refute some of the many 
anti-anarchist diatribes produced by Marxists. While 
we have covered why anarchists oppose Marxism in
<a href="secHcon.html">section H</a>, we thought it 
would be useful to reply to Marxist webpages and 
books whose content is not explicitly
covered in that section. In this way we hope to 
indicate that Marxism is a flawed theory, flawed
even to the extent of not being able to present a
honest critique of anarchism. This consistent attempt
to smear anarchism and distort its history and ideas
is no co-incidence -- rather it is required in order
to present Marxism as the only viable form of socialism
and, more importantly, to hide the fact that much of
the populist Marxist rhetoric was, in fact, said by
anarchists first and latter stolen by Marxists to hide
the authoritarian basis of their politics.
<p>
One last point. We are aware that we repeat many of our
arguments in these appendices. That, unfortunately, is
avoidable for two reasons. Firstly, Marxists usually
repeat the same false assertions against anarchism and
so we have to answer them each time they appear. Marxists
seem to subscribe to the point of view that repeating an
error often enough makes it true. Secondly, we have tried
to make each appendix as self-contained as possible and
that meant repeating certain material and arguments to
achieve this. We hope the reader understands.
