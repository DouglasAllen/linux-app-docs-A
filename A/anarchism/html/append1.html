<h1>Appendix : Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism </h1>

This appendix exists for one reason, namely to explain why the idea
of "anarcho"-capitalism is a bogus one. While we have covered this topic
in <a href="secFcon.html">section F</a>, we thought that this appendix should be created in order to
discuss in more detail why anarchists reject both "anarcho"-capitalism
and its claims to being anarchist.
<p>
This appendix has three parts. The first two sections are our critique of 
Bryan Caplan's "anarcho"-capitalist <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm">"Anarchist Theory FAQ."</a> Caplan's FAQ is 
the main on-line attempt to give the oxymoron of "anarcho"-capitalism some 
form of justification and so it is worthwhile explaining, using his FAQ as 
the base, why such an attempt fails. The last part of this appendix is the original version of <a href="secFcon.html">section F</a>, 
<p>
As we will prove, Caplan's FAQ fails in its attempt to show that "anarcho"
capitalism can be considered as part of the anarchist movement and in fact his 
account involves extensive re-writing of history. This appendix is in two 
parts, a reply to Caplan's most recent FAQ release (version 5.2) and an 
older reply to version 4.1.1 (which was originally section F.10 of the FAQ).
The <a href="append12.html">introduction</a> to the reply to version 4.1.1 indicates what most anarchists
think of Caplan's FAQ and its claims of "objectivity" as so we will not
repeat ourselves here.
<p>
We decided to replace the original version of section F with an edited 
version simply because the original section was too long in respect to 
the rest of the FAQ. While 
this FAQ may have started out as a rebuttal to "anarcho"-capitalist 
claims of being anarchist, it no longer is. As such, in an <b><i>anarchist</i></b>  
FAQ section F became redundant as "anarcho"-capitalism is a fringe 
ideology even within the USA. If it were not for their presence on 
the web and some academics taking their claims to being anarchists 
at face value, we would only mention them in passing.
<p>
We have decided to include this appendix as it is really an addition to 
the main body of the FAQ. Parties interested in why "anarcho"-capitalist
claims are false can explore this appendix, those who are 
interested in anarchist politics can read the FAQ without having to also 
read too many arguments between anarchists and capitalists. We should, 
perhaps, thank Caplan for allowing us an opportunity of explaining the 
ideas of such people as Proudhon and Tucker, allowing us to quote them 
and so bring their ideas to a wider audience and for indicating that 
anarchism, in all its forms, has always opposed capitalism and always will.
