                         Language-Defined Attributes


1   {attribute} This annex summarizes the definitions given elsewhere of the
language-defined attributes.

2   P'Access    For a prefix P that denotes a subprogram:

3               P'Access yields an access value that designates the subprogram
                denoted by P. The type of P'Access is an access-to-subprogram
                type (S), as determined by the expected type. See 3.10.2.

4   X'Access    For a prefix X that denotes an aliased view of an object:

5               X'Access yields an access value that designates the object
                denoted by X. The type of X'Access is an access-to-object
                type, as determined by the expected type. The expected type
                shall be a general access type. See 3.10.2.

6/1 X'Address   For a prefix X that denotes an object, program unit, or label:

7               Denotes the address of the first of the storage elements
                allocated to X. For a program unit or label, this value refers
                to the machine code associated with the corresponding body or
                statement. The value of this attribute is of type
                System.Address. See 13.3.

8   S'Adjacent  For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

9               S'Adjacent denotes a function with the following
                specification:

10                  function S'Adjacent (X, Towards : T)
                      return T

11              {Constraint_Error (raised by failure of run-time check)} If
                Towards = X, the function yields X; otherwise, it yields the
                machine number of the type T adjacent to X in the direction of
                Towards, if that machine number exists. {Range_Check
                 [partial]} {check, language-defined (Range_Check)} If the
                result would be outside the base range of S, Constraint_Error
                is raised. When T'Signed_Zeros is True, a zero result has the
                sign of X. When Towards is zero, its sign has no bearing on
                the result. See A.5.3.

12  S'Aft       For every fixed point subtype S:

13              S'Aft yields the number of decimal digits needed after the
                decimal point to accommodate the delta of the subtype S,
                unless the delta of the subtype S is greater than 0.1, in
                which case the attribute yields the value one. (S'Aft is the
                smallest positive integer N for which (10**N)*S'Delta is
                greater than or equal to one.) The value of this attribute is
                of the type universal_integer. See 3.5.10.

13.1/2 S'Alignment
                For every subtype S:

13.2/2          The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer, and
                nonnegative.

13.3/2          For an object X of subtype S, if S'Alignment is not zero, then
                X'Alignment is a nonzero integral multiple of S'Alignment
                unless specified otherwise by a representation item. See
                13.3.

14/1 X'Alignment
                For a prefix X that denotes an object:

15              The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer, and
                nonnegative; zero means that the object is not necessarily
                aligned on a storage element boundary. If X'Alignment is not
                zero, then X is aligned on a storage unit boundary and
                X'Address is an integral multiple of X'Alignment (that is, the
                Address modulo the Alignment is zero).

16/2            This paragraph was deleted. See 13.3.

17  S'Base      For every scalar subtype S:

18              S'Base denotes an unconstrained subtype of the type of S. This
                unconstrained subtype is called the base subtype of the type.
                See 3.5.

19  S'Bit_Order For every specific record subtype S:

20              Denotes the bit ordering for the type of S. The value of this
                attribute is of type System.Bit_Order. See 13.5.3.

21/1 P'Body_Version
                For a prefix P that statically denotes a program unit:

22              Yields a value of the predefined type String that identifies
                the version of the compilation unit that contains the body
                (but not any subunits) of the program unit. See E.3.

23  T'Callable  For a prefix T that is of a task type (after any implicit
                dereference):

24              Yields the value True when the task denoted by T is callable,
                and False otherwise; See 9.9.

25  E'Caller    For a prefix E that denotes an entry_declaration:

26              Yields a value of the type Task_Id that identifies the task
                whose call is now being serviced. Use of this attribute is
                allowed only inside an entry_body or accept_statement
                corresponding to the entry_declaration denoted by E. See
                C.7.1.

27  S'Ceiling   For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

28              S'Ceiling denotes a function with the following specification:

29                  function S'Ceiling (X : T)
                      return T

30              The function yields the value Ceiling(X), i.e., the smallest
                (most negative) integral value greater than or equal to X.
                When X is zero, the result has the sign of X; a zero result
                otherwise has a negative sign when S'Signed_Zeros is True. See
                A.5.3.

31  S'Class     For every subtype S of a tagged type T (specific or
                class-wide):

32              S'Class denotes a subtype of the class-wide type (called
                T'Class in this International Standard) for the class rooted
                at T (or if S already denotes a class-wide subtype, then
                S'Class is the same as S).

33              {unconstrained (subtype)} {constrained (subtype)} S'Class is
                unconstrained. However, if S is constrained, then the values
                of S'Class are only those that when converted to the type T
                belong to S. See 3.9.

34  S'Class     For every subtype S of an untagged private type whose full
                view is tagged:

35              Denotes the class-wide subtype corresponding to the full view
                of S. This attribute is allowed only from the beginning of the
                private part in which the full view is declared, until the
                declaration of the full view. After the full view, the Class
                attribute of the full view can be used. See 7.3.1.

36/1 X'Component_Size
                For a prefix X that denotes an array subtype or array object
                (after any implicit dereference):

37              Denotes the size in bits of components of the type of X. The
                value of this attribute is of type universal_integer. See
                13.3.

38  S'Compose   For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

39              S'Compose denotes a function with the following specification:

40                  function S'Compose (Fraction : T;
                                        Exponent : universal_integer)
                      return T

41              {Constraint_Error (raised by failure of run-time check)} Let v
                be the value Fraction  T'Machine_Radix(Exponent-k), where k
                is the normalized exponent of Fraction. If v is a machine
                number of the type T, or if |v| >= T'Model_Small, the function
                yields v; otherwise, it yields either one of the machine
                numbers of the type T adjacent to v. {Range_Check [partial]}
                {check, language-defined (Range_Check)} Constraint_Error is
                optionally raised if v is outside the base range of S. A zero
                result has the sign of Fraction when S'Signed_Zeros is True.
                See A.5.3.

42  A'Constrained
                For a prefix A that is of a discriminated type (after any
                implicit dereference):

43              Yields the value True if A denotes a constant, a value, or a
                constrained variable, and False otherwise. See 3.7.2.

44  S'Copy_Sign For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

45              S'Copy_Sign denotes a function with the following
                specification:

46                  function S'Copy_Sign (Value, Sign : T)
                      return T

47              {Constraint_Error (raised by failure of run-time check)} If
                the value of Value is nonzero, the function yields a result
                whose magnitude is that of Value and whose sign is that of
                Sign; otherwise, it yields the value zero. {Range_Check
                 [partial]} {check, language-defined (Range_Check)}
                Constraint_Error is optionally raised if the result is outside
                the base range of S. A zero result has the sign of Sign when
                S'Signed_Zeros is True. See A.5.3.

48  E'Count     For a prefix E that denotes an entry of a task or protected
                unit:

49              Yields the number of calls presently queued on the entry E of
                the current instance of the unit. The value of this attribute
                is of the type universal_integer. See 9.9.

50/1 S'Definite For a prefix S that denotes a formal indefinite subtype:

51              S'Definite yields True if the actual subtype corresponding to
                S is definite; otherwise it yields False. The value of this
                attribute is of the predefined type Boolean. See 12.5.1.

52  S'Delta     For every fixed point subtype S:

53              S'Delta denotes the delta of the fixed point subtype S. The
                value of this attribute is of the type universal_real. See
                3.5.10.

54  S'Denorm    For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

55              Yields the value True if every value expressible in the form
                     mantissa  T'Machine_Radix(T'Machine_Emin)
                where mantissa is a nonzero T'Machine_Mantissa-digit fraction
                in the number base T'Machine_Radix, the first digit of which
                is zero, is a machine number (see 3.5.7) of the type T; yields
                the value False otherwise. The value of this attribute is of
                the predefined type Boolean. See A.5.3.

56  S'Digits    For every floating point subtype S:

57              S'Digits denotes the requested decimal precision for the
                subtype S. The value of this attribute is of the type
                universal_integer. See 3.5.8.

58  S'Digits    For every decimal fixed point subtype S:

59              S'Digits denotes the digits of the decimal fixed point subtype
                S, which corresponds to the number of decimal digits that are
                representable in objects of the subtype. The value of this
                attribute is of the type universal_integer. See 3.5.10.

60  S'Exponent  For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

61              S'Exponent denotes a function with the following
                specification:

62                  function S'Exponent (X : T)
                      return universal_integer

63              The function yields the normalized exponent of X. See A.5.3.

64  S'External_Tag
                For every subtype S of a tagged type T (specific or
                class-wide):

65              {External_Tag clause}
                {specifiable (of External_Tag for a tagged type) [partial]}
                S'External_Tag denotes an external string representation for
                S'Tag; it is of the predefined type String. External_Tag may
                be specified for a specific tagged type via an
                attribute_definition_clause; the expression of such a clause
                shall be static. The default external tag representation is
                implementation defined. See 3.9.2 and 13.13.2. See 13.3.

66/1 A'First    For a prefix A that is of an array type (after any implicit
                dereference), or denotes a constrained array subtype:

67              A'First denotes the lower bound of the first index range; its
                type is the corresponding index type. See 3.6.2.

68  S'First     For every scalar subtype S:

69              S'First denotes the lower bound of the range of S. The value
                of this attribute is of the type of S. See 3.5.

70/1 A'First(N) For a prefix A that is of an array type (after any implicit
                dereference), or denotes a constrained array subtype:

71              A'First(N) denotes the lower bound of the N-th index range;
                its type is the corresponding index type. See 3.6.2.

72  R.C'First_Bit
                For a component C of a composite, non-array object R:

73/2            If the nondefault bit ordering applies to the composite type,
                and if a component_clause specifies the placement of C,
                denotes the value given for the first_bit of the
                component_clause; otherwise, denotes the offset, from the
                start of the first of the storage elements occupied by C, of
                the first bit occupied by C. This offset is measured in bits.
                The first bit of a storage element is numbered zero. The value
                of this attribute is of the type universal_integer. See
                13.5.2.

74  S'Floor     For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

75              S'Floor denotes a function with the following specification:

76                  function S'Floor (X : T)
                      return T

77              The function yields the value Floor(X), i.e., the largest
                (most positive) integral value less than or equal to X. When X
                is zero, the result has the sign of X; a zero result otherwise
                has a positive sign. See A.5.3.

78  S'Fore      For every fixed point subtype S:

79              S'Fore yields the minimum number of characters needed before
                the decimal point for the decimal representation of any value
                of the subtype S, assuming that the representation does not
                include an exponent, but includes a one-character prefix that
                is either a minus sign or a space. (This minimum number does
                not include superfluous zeros or underlines, and is at least
                2.) The value of this attribute is of the type
                universal_integer. See 3.5.10.

80  S'Fraction  For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

81              S'Fraction denotes a function with the following
                specification:

82                  function S'Fraction (X : T)
                      return T

83              The function yields the value X  T'Machine_Radix(-k), where k
                is the normalized exponent of X. A zero result, which can only
                occur when X is zero, has the sign of X. See A.5.3.

84/1 E'Identity For a prefix E that denotes an exception:

85              E'Identity returns the unique identity of the exception. The
                type of this attribute is Exception_Id. See 11.4.1.

86  T'Identity  For a prefix T that is of a task type (after any implicit
                dereference):

87              Yields a value of the type Task_Id that identifies the task
                denoted by T. See C.7.1.

88  S'Image     For every scalar subtype S:

89              S'Image denotes a function with the following specification:

90                  function S'Image(Arg : S'Base)
                      return String

91/2            The function returns an image of the value of Arg as a String.
                See 3.5.

92  S'Class'Input
                For every subtype S'Class of a class-wide type T'Class:

93              S'Class'Input denotes a function with the following
                specification:

94/2                function S'Class'Input(
                       Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class)
                       return T'Class

95/2            First reads the external tag from Stream and determines the
                corresponding internal tag (by calling
                Tags.Descendant_Tag(String'Input(Stream), S'Tag) which might
                raise Tag_Error - see 3.9) and then dispatches to the
                subprogram denoted by the Input attribute of the specific type
                identified by the internal tag; returns that result. If the
                specific type identified by the internal tag is not covered by
                T'Class or is abstract, Constraint_Error is raised. See
                13.13.2.

96  S'Input     For every subtype S of a specific type T:

97              S'Input denotes a function with the following specification:

98/2                function S'Input(
                       Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class)
                       return T

99              S'Input reads and returns one value from Stream, using any
                bounds or discriminants written by a corresponding S'Output to
                determine how much to read. See 13.13.2.

100/1 A'Last    For a prefix A that is of an array type (after any implicit
                dereference), or denotes a constrained array subtype:

101             A'Last denotes the upper bound of the first index range; its
                type is the corresponding index type. See 3.6.2.

102 S'Last      For every scalar subtype S:

103             S'Last denotes the upper bound of the range of S. The value of
                this attribute is of the type of S. See 3.5.

104/1 A'Last(N) For a prefix A that is of an array type (after any implicit
                dereference), or denotes a constrained array subtype:

105             A'Last(N) denotes the upper bound of the N-th index range; its

                access type whose designated subtype is S. For a type with
                access discriminants, if the implementation allocates space
                for a coextension in the same pool as that of the object
                having the access discriminant, then this accounts for any
                calls on Allocate that could be performed to provide space for
                such coextensions. The value of this attribute is of type
                universal_integer. See 13.11.1.

                      return T

202             {Constraint_Error (raised by failure of run-time check)} For
                nonzero Y, let v be the value X - n  Y, where n is the
                integer nearest to the exact value of X/Y; if |n - X/Y| = 1/2,

                type T, the function yields v; otherwise, it yields zero.
                {Division_Check [partial]}
                {check, language-defined (Division_Check)} Constraint_Error is
                raised if Y is zero. A zero result has the sign of X when
                S'Signed_Zeros is True. See A.5.3.

209                 function S'Rounding (X : T)
                      return T

210             The function yields the integral value nearest to X, rounding
                away from zero if X lies exactly halfway between two integers.
                A zero result has the sign of X when S'Signed_Zeros is True.

                      return T

220             {Constraint_Error (raised by failure of run-time check)} Let v
                be the value X  T'Machine_Radix(Adjustment). If v is a
                machine number of the type T, or if |v| >= T'Model_Small, the
                function yields v; otherwise, it yields either one of the
                machine numbers of the type T adjacent to v. {Range_Check
                 [partial]} {check, language-defined (Range_Check)}
                Constraint_Error is optionally raised if v is outside the base
                range of S. A zero result has the sign of X when

                subtype S:

225               * A record component of subtype S when the record type is
                    packed.

226               * The formal parameter of an instance of
                    Unchecked_Conversion that converts from subtype S to some
                    other subtype.

227             If S is indefinite, the meaning is implementation defined. The

234 S'Storage_Size
                For every access-to-object subtype S:

235             Yields the result of calling Storage_Size(S'Storage_Pool),
                which is intended to be a measure of the number of storage
                elements reserved for the pool. The type of this attribute is
                universal_integer. See 13.11.

236/1 T'Storage_Size
                For a prefix T that denotes a task object (after any implicit
                dereference):

                The value of this attribute is of the type universal_integer.
                The Storage_Size includes the size of the task's stack, if
                any. The language does not specify whether or not it includes
                other storage associated with the task (such as the "task
                control block" used by some implementations.) See 13.3.

                an enumeration type, the function returns the value whose
                position number is one more than that of the value of Arg;
                {Range_Check [partial]}
                {check, language-defined (Range_Check)} Constraint_Error is
                raised if there is no such value of the type. For an integer
                type, the function returns the result of adding one to the
                value of Arg. For a fixed point type, the function returns the
                result of adding small to the value of Arg. For a floating
                point type, the function returns the machine number (as
                defined in 3.5.7) immediately above the value of Arg;
                {Range_Check [partial]}

                apply also to X'Unchecked_Access, except that, for the
                purposes of accessibility rules and checks, it is as if X were
                declared immediately within a library package. See 13.10.
