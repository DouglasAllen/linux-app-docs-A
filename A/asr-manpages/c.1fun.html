NAME
       c - genericised soft drink generator (ie coffee, coke etc)

SYNOPSIS
       c [-s[number]] [-m[type]] [-e] [-i] [-T] [-S amount] [--other=drink]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the   GNU   version   of  c.   c is a genericised  soft  drinks  engine
       designed to provide a stream of  the  desired  beverage on the  standard  output.     By   default,  c
       makes  coffee,   white,  no  sugar.  This is  a   historical  choice based on the authors preferences.
       This behaviour is controlled  by the options,  and a  wide  range   of  other  drinks   are  possible.
       Please   note  that  not all   combinations make sense,  in taste terms, but that parsing by c extends
       only to syntax. Experiment at your own risk.

OPTIONS
       -s[number]
              Specifies the  number of sugars  desired.  If  this option is omitted, none will be included.

              Excessively large values will  result in unpleasant side effects,   including   rotting   teeth
              and excess weight.

              If this option is specified with no parameter, the default is one.

       -m[type]
              Determines   whether  milk  will  be used or not.  The default corresponds to the specification
              'cold'.  cold - Normal, cold milk

              hot Normal, hot milk

              frth Frothed milk (see -e option for cappucino)

              none No milk. Recommended for those who have a deadline.

              goat Use your imagination.


       -e     Espresso  option.  High  pressure  steam  is forced  through  fine  ground  dark  beans  for  a
              stronger brew; careful  use of the -S  option  is advised to avoid shaky hands and heart palpi‐
              tations (see BUGS).

       -i     Iced coffee. Self explanatory really...

       -T     Turkish coffee.  The only  type of  coffee that  is boiled deliberately.  -s2  or more   recom‐
              mended  to avoid grimaces.

       -S[amount]
              Size   of  the  virtual  'mug'  to be filled. The scale used is  fairly  arbitrary,  but should
              cover  most cases...  1 thimbleful

              2 espresso cup

              3 cafe-style coffee cup

              4 office mug

              5 sysadmin mug

              6 bucket

              Use of -S 6 is contraindicated  for use with  n(1), due to possible  damage   to  t  he   nasal
              membranes,   and  risk   of  drowning.   The  default is 4; unless a beta version of  the OS is
              installed, when the default is 5.  If the beta is of Digital UNIX, 6  is  the  default;  you'll
              need it.

       --other=drink
              Specify   a  drink other  than coffee.  Use  of other options  is   not  recommended;  the  be‐
              haviour  is unspecified!

BUGS
       Caffeine overdose can result by inadvised combinations  of options (ie -e  and large  values for  -S).
       If  you   suffer  from   increased   heart  rate,   visual disturbance,  shaking hands,  shortness  of
       breath,  it is  suggested  that you discontinue  use.   A -d (decaf) option  was  included  in  previ‐
       ous versions,  but was  removed  after  a  threatened litigation  arising  from an  unfortunate  prac‐
       tical  joke involving misuse.
