email_extra_info='
The test environment is an i386 Xen guest with limited amounts of
memory.  The relevant dependencies are installed for each test but
very few other packages.  Most autopkgtest reports are FTBFS problems.
Failures to satisfy build-dependencies are sometimes due to ambiguity
rather than simple lack of a suitable package.

While this bug remains open and assigned to this package, no further
retesting will be done and no additional bugs will be filed.  When you
have corrected the problem, close the bug and your package will be
immediately eligible for retesting.

If this automatic testing and bug filing is undesirable for certain
packages(s) please let me know and I will add them to my blacklist.
