<h1>Section J - What do anarchists do?</h1> 

<p> 
This section discusses what anarchists get up to. There is little point 
thinking about the world unless you also want to change it for the better. 
And by trying to change it, you change yourself and others, making radical 
change more of a possibility. Therefore anarchists give their whole-hearted  
support to attempts by ordinary people to improve their lives by their  
own actions. We urge <i>"<b>emancipation through practical action</b>"</i>
recognising that the <i>"collective experience"</i> gained in <i>"the
collective struggle of the workers against the bosses"</i> will transform
how they see the world and the world itself. [Bakunin, <b>The Basic Bakunin</b>, 
p. 103] Ultimately, <i>"[t]he true man does not lie in the future, an object 
of longing, but lies, existent and real, in the present."</i> [Stirner,
<b>The Ego and Its Own</b>, p. 327] 
</p><p> 
Anarchism is more than just a critique of statism and capitalism 
or a vision of a freer, better way of life. It is first and foremost 
a movement, the movement of working class people attempting to  
change the world. Therefore the kind of activity we discuss in this  
section of the FAQ forms the bridge between capitalism and anarchy. By  
self-activity and direct action, people can change both themselves and  
their surroundings. They develop within themselves the mental, ethical and  
spiritual qualities which can make an anarchist society a viable option.  
As Noam Chomsky argues:
<blockquote>
<i>"Only through their own struggle for liberation  will ordinary 
people come to comprehend their true nature, suppressed and distorted 
within institutional structures designed to assure obedience and  
subordination. Only in this way will people develop more humane ethical  
standards, 'a new sense of right', 'the consciousness of their strength and  
their importance as a social factor in the life of their time' and their  
capacity to realise the strivings of their 'inmost nature.' Such direct 
engagement in the work of social reconstruction is a prerequisite for 
coming to perceive this 'inmost nature' and is the indispensable  
foundations upon which it can flourish"</i> [<i>"preface"</i>, Rudolf 
Rocker, <b>Anarcho-Syndicalism</b>, p. iii] 
</blockquote></p><p> 
In other words, anarchism is not primarily a vision of a better future, but  
the actual social movement which is fighting within the current unjust and  
unfree society for that better future and to improve things in the here and  
now. Without standing up for yourself and what you believe is right, nothing  
will change. Thus anarchy can be found <i>"wherever free thought breaks 
loose from the chains of dogma; wherever the spirit of inquiry rejects the 
old formulas, wherver the human will asserts itself through independent 
actions; wherever honest people, rebelling against all enforced discipline, 
join freely together in order to educate themselves, and to reclaim, without 
any master, their share of life, and the complete satisfaction of their 
needs."</i> [Elisée Reclus, quoted by John P. Clark and Camille Martin (ed.), 
<b>Anarchy, Geography, Modernity</b>, p. 62]
</p><p> 
For anarchists, the future is <b>already appearing in the present</b> and 
is expressed by the creativity of working class self-activity. Anarchy is 
not some-day-to-be-achieved utopia, it is a living reality whose growth 
only needs to be freed from constraint. As such anarchist activity  
is about discovering and aiding emerging trends of mutual aid which 
work against capitalist domination, so the Anarchist <i>"studies society 
and tries to discover its <b>tendencies</b>, past and present, its growing 
needs, intellectual and economic, and in his [or her] ideal he merely points 
out in which direction evolution goes."</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Anarchism</b>,  
p. 47] Indeed, as we discussed in <a href="secI2.html#seci23">section I.2.3</a>,
the future structures of a free society are created in the struggles against 
oppression today.
</p><p> 
The kinds of activity outlined in this section are a general overview 
of anarchist work. It is by no means exclusive -- we are sure to have 
left something out. However, the key aspect of <b>real</b> anarchist 
activity is <b><i>direct action</i></b> - self-activity, self-help, 
self-liberation  and solidarity (<i>"We wish,"</i> as French syndicalist 
Fernand Pelloutier wrote, <i>"that the emancipation of the people might 
be the work of the people themselves."</i> [quoted by Jeremy Jennings, 
<b>Syndicalism in France</b>, p. 18]). Such activity may be done by 
individuals (for example, propaganda work), but usually anarchists 
emphasise collective activity. This is because most of our problems 
are of a social nature, meaning that their solutions can only be worked 
on collectively. Individual solutions to social problems are doomed to 
failure, at best slowing down what they are opposed to (most obviously, 
ethical consumerism as discussed in 
<a href="secE5.html">section E.5</a>). 
In addition, 
collective action gets us used to working together, promoting the 
experience of self-management and building organisations that will allow 
us to actively manage our own affairs. Also, and we would like to emphasise  
this, it can be <b>fun</b> to get together with other people and work 
with them, it can be fulfilling and empowering. 
</p><p> 
Anarchists do not ask those in power to give up that power. No, we 
promote forms of activity and organisation by which all the oppressed 
can liberate themselves by their own hands. In other words, we do not 
think that those in power will altruistically renounce that power or 
their privileges. Instead, the oppressed must take the power <b>back</b> 
into their own hands by their own actions. We must free ourselves, 
no one else can do it for use. 
</p><p> 
Here we will discuss anarchist ideas on struggle, what anarchists 
actually (and, almost as importantly, do not) do in the here and 
now and the sort of alternatives anarchists try to build within 
statism and capitalism in order to destroy them. As well as a struggle  
against oppression, anarchist activity is also struggle for freedom. As  
well as fighting against material poverty, anarchists combat spiritual  
poverty. By resisting hierarchy we emphasis the importance of <b>living</b>  
and of <b>life as art.</b> By proclaiming <i><b>"Neither Master nor Slave"</b></i> 
we urge an ethical transformation, a transformation that will help create the  
possibility of a truly free society. This point was stressed by Emma Goldman 
after she saw the defeat of the Russian Revolution by a combination of 
Leninist politics and capitalist armed intervention: 
</p><p><blockquote>
<i>"revolution is in vain unless inspired by its ultimate ideal. Revolutionary
methods must be in tune with revolutionary aims . . . In short, the ethical 
values which the revolution is to establish must be initiated with the 
revolutionary activities . . . The latter can only serve as a real and 
dependable bridge to the better life if built of the same material as  
the life to be achieved."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 404] 
</p><p></blockquote>
In other words, anarchist activity is more than creating libertarian 
alternatives and resisting hierarchy, it is about building the new 
world in the shell of the old not only with regards to organisations 
and self-activity, but also within the individual. It is about transforming 
yourself while transforming the world (both processes obviously interacting 
and supporting each other) for while <i>"we associate ourselves with others
in working for . . . social revolution, which for us means the destruction 
of all monopoly and all government, and the direct seizure by the workers
of the means of production"</i> we do not forget that <i>"the first aim of 
Anarchism is to assert and make good the dignity of the individual human 
being."</i> [Charlotte Wilson, <b>Anarchist Essays</b>, p. 43 and p. 51] 
</p><p> 
By direct action, self-management and self-activity we can make the words 
first heard in Paris, 1968 a living reality: <i><b>"All power to the 
imagination!"</i></b> Words, we are sure, previous generations of anarchists
would have whole-heartedly agreed with. There is a power in humans, a creative 
power, a power to alter <i>what is</i> into <i>what should be</i>. Anarchists 
try to create alternatives that will allow that power to be expressed, the 
power of imagination. 
</p><p> 
Such a social movement will change how we act as individuals, with 
anarchists seeking to apply our principles in our daily lives as much 
as our daily struggles. This means that libertarians must change how 
we relate to our comrades and fellow workers by applying our egalitarian
ideals everywhere. Part of the task of anarchists is to challenge social 
hierarchies everywhere, including in the home. As Durruti put it:
</p><p><blockquote>
<i>"When will you stop thinking like the bourgeoisie, that women 
are men's servants? It's enough that society is divided into
classes. We're not going to make even more classes by creating
differences between men and women in our own homes!"</i> [quoted by
Abel Paz, <b>Durruti in the Spanish Revolution</b>, p. 341]
</blockquote>
</p><p>
So we have a interactive process of struggle and transformation of both
society and the individuals within it. In the sections that follow we will 
discuss the forms of self-activity and self-organisation which anarchists 
think will stimulate and develop the imagination of those oppressed by 
hierarchy, build anarchy in action and help create a free society.
